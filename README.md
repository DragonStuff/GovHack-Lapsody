The project aims to bring together big data, augmented reality, and real-time analysis in an innovative solution to the wickedness of environmental sustainability. Whilst it is widely acknowledged that each individual needs to do their bit in order to preserve our local environment, could more be done? Is there a way to see what could happen if the damage becomes too far gone?

As a product of GovHack Sydney 2015, Lapsody is the ambitious brainchild of Alexander Nicholson, Jeremy Vista, Joseph Hilsberg, and Laura Rojas.
